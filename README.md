Viph
=========

An extension to see where your data is going

Viph is an open source browser extension that crowdsources and publishes the data collection policies of individual websites. By adding Viph to your browser you can get a glimpse in to what kind of data any site you visit expects you to forfeit by interacting with it. You can view and edit data collection policies directly from the extension with a simple UI.

When you know where your data is going you can better protect it.
